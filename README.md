If you've never heard of [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) you are in for a treat. Anki is an open source [spaced repetition system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) that allows you to memorize material faster. Think of flashcards on steroids. 

Check Anki out at: https://apps.ankiweb.net/ and see how other humans are using it to [better themselves](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=anki+learn).
